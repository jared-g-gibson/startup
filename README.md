[My Notes](notes.md)

I am planning on creating a website that functions as a digital time capsule. There will be opportunities to share the capsules you create with friends and family.

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever wanted to encapsulate a moment in time? With this website, that dream is now a reality! Introducing Capsules, a website that creates a virtual time capsule curated by you. This time capsule will include features such as uploading images/videos, journaling about them, and sharing those capsules with friends. Come be a part of the Capsules team now!

#### Rough Sketch of Application

![Page 5](public/specification_images/page_5.jpg)

Here is a rough sketch of my application. Each page represents a different page of the website.

### Key features

- There will be a login page. From the login page you will be able to create your account.
- Once you are logged in, you will be at the home page. The home page will lead to the View Capsules Page, Create Capsule Page, and Social Page.
- View Capsules Page views current capsules.
- Create Capsule Page creates a new capsule.
- Social Page allows you to connect with friends and collaborate on capsules.
- At any time, you can logout of your account.


### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - HTML will be used to create the main structure of the application. There will be 5 main pages, with possibly more added in the future. 5 main pages are disucssed in Key Features. 
- **CSS** - CSS will be used to apply styling to create consistent, professional feel amongs the main pages. It will also look good on any screen the website is rendered on.
- **React** - React will be used to handle the components of the website. Provides the logic of which components to display at what time.
- **Service** - Backend Service will have endpoints for logging in, accessing capsule database, creating capsules, adding friends, and seeing friends lists. A third party service will be used to display a random fact about the day you are logging in on (September 10).
- **DB/Login** - Stores the users and their credentials in a database. Database will also store the capsule information for each user.
- **WebSocket** - Websocket will allow users to connect with other users and become "friends" on the website. The friend requests will be broadcasted to other users.
